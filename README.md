# Agile SDLC Task & Prompt Generator

This application is a powerful tool for project managers, team leads, and developers designed to streamline the initial phases of project planning. By uploading project documents such as requirements, Statements of Work (SOWs), or coding standards, users can automatically generate a structured list of tasks categorized by Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) roles and relevant Agile frameworks.

Beyond simple task creation, it also generates actionable Natural Language Processing (NLP) prompts for each task, enabling seamless integration with internal AI assistants or tools. The standout feature is the **Orchestration Prompt Generator**, which creates a master prompt to simulate an autonomous AI project manager, capable of planning, delegating, and managing the entire project workflow.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-File Upload**: Upload up to 10 project documents at once, including PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, MD, and CSV files.
-   **Intelligent Document Analysis**: Leverages the Google Gemini API to read and understand the content of your documents.
-   **Role-Based Task Generation**: Automatically identifies and creates tasks for various SDLC roles, such as:
    -   Product Owner
    -   Scrum Master
    -   Developer
    -   QA Engineer
    -   DevOps Engineer
    -   UX/UI Designer
-   **Agile Framework Tagging**: Each role and its associated tasks are tagged with relevant Agile frameworks like **Scrum**, **SAFe**, and **Kanban**.
-   **NLP Prompt Crafting**: For every task, a concise and effective NLP prompt is generated, ready to be used with AI tools to assist or automate the work (e.g., *"Generate user stories for the login feature based on the requirements doc."*).
-   **Orchestration Prompt Generation**: After tasks are generated, create a comprehensive, high-level "master prompt". This prompt instructs an advanced AI model to act as an autonomous project manager, using the generated tasks to:
    -   Establish a project plan and identify dependencies.
    -   Simulate task delegation and progress tracking.
    -   Define a communication protocol (e.g., daily stand-up summaries).
    -   Outline a decision-making framework for handling roadblocks.
-   **Interactive & Responsive UI**: A clean, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS, featuring an accordion view to easily navigate results and a modal for displaying the orchestration prompt.
-   **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Easily copy individual NLP prompts or the entire orchestration prompt with a single click.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **API Key**: Ensure your `API_KEY` for the Google Gemini API is correctly configured as an environment variable. The application will show an error if it's missing.
2.  **Upload Documents**: Drag and drop your project files onto the upload area or click to select them from your computer. You can upload multiple files at once.
3.  **Generate Tasks**: Click the **"Generate Tasks"** button. The application will process each file and display a progress indicator.
4.  **Review Results**: The generated tasks will appear in an accordion, neatly organized by SDLC role. You can expand each role to see the detailed tasks, associated Agile frameworks, and the corresponding NLP prompts.
5.  **Create Orchestration Prompt**: Once you are satisfied with the generated tasks, click the **"‚ú® Create Orchestration Prompt"** button.
6.  **Use the Master Prompt**: A modal will appear displaying the orchestration prompt. Copy it and use it with a powerful AI model (like Gemini) to kick off an autonomous project management simulation.

## üîß Local Development Setup

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps. This project is set up to run directly in the browser without a complex build process.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
-   A code editor (like Visual Studio Code).
-   A [Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
-   A local web server. Most operating systems come with tools for this. For example, Python or Node.js can be used to run a simple server.

### 2. Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. Because the code runs in a browser, you need to securely provide this key for local development.

1.  **Create a Configuration File**: In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `env.js`.
2.  **Add Your API Key**: Open `env.js` and add the following line, replacing `'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key:
    ```javascript
    // env.js
    window.process = { env: { API_KEY: 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE' } };
    ```
    *__Note:__ This method is suitable for local development only. Do not commit this file or expose it publicly if it contains a valid API key.*

3.  **Link the Configuration File**: Open the `index.html` file and add the following script tag inside the `<head>` section, just before the `<script type="importmap">`:
    ```html
    <!-- index.html -->
    <head>
      ...
      <script src="/env.js"></script>
      <script type="importmap">
      ...
    </head>
    ```

### 3. Running the Application

You need to serve the files from a local web server because modern browsers have security restrictions (CORS policy) that prevent modules from loading directly from the local file system (`file:///`).

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3.  Start a local server. Here are a few common examples:

    -   **Using Python 3:**
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.

    -   **Using Node.js and `serve`:**
        If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `serve` package.
        ```bash
        npx serve
        ```
        The server will give you an address, typically `http://localhost:3000`. Open this address in your browser.

4.  Once the server is running, you can access the application and start generating tasks.
